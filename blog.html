<h3>Week 1</h3>
<p>This is the first week of me having this module. I found out that I am the only business student in this elective and I am ready to embrace the unique experience I will encounter.</p>
<p>This week I learnt about how to stay safe and follow the rules of the Fablab and a brief rundown on how the module is going to be like. I also managed to pass my safety quiz which will allow me to enter Fablab yay!</p>

<h3>Week 2</h3>
<p>This week I learnt about the different tools I will get to use during this elective and which one to choose. This is also my first time doing coding of any sorts. I am excited to learn about HTML. Another life skill attain!</p>

<h3>Week 3</h3>
<p>I learn about CSS this week which is the layout of the website as it helps to decorate the HTML codes, sort of. I also made a Github account and I learnt that most of the companies started off using Github to upload their codes and do testing. I have successfully managed to put my HTML code into a Github website which is avaliable to be viewed by anyone!</p>

<h3>Week 4</h3>
<p>I learn about CAD and did my first Fusion360 sketch which was drawing exercise 1. Afterwards, we started doing many exercises on Fusion360 to learn about the different function and capabilities.</p>

<h3>Week 5</h3>
<p>This week we learn about Computer Controlled Cutting which will be used for laser cutting. Later that week, we had a more indepth lesson about Computer Controlled Cutting which will allow us to have deeper knowledge about the technology. Turns out laser cutting have many degrees of power and high accuracy. As I am from business school, this is all very new to me and I find it very interesting!</p>
