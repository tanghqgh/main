	<h3>Why I chose this module</h3>
	<p>
		Together with my diploma course mates, we run a small startup specialised in assembling acrylic keyboards and providing keyboard parts to the Singapore market. As referred to my project tab, I plan to build a customised mechanical keyboard with an acrylic base similar to the product that we are already selling.
	</p>

<p>
	I will be using parts provided by myself which includes the Switches, Hot-Swappable PCB and Keycaps. In order to fufill this module requirements, I will be laser cutting the acrylic plates for the case of the keyboard, code the PCB with QMK and 3D printing the "WASD" keycaps.
